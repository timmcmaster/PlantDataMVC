# Future dev tasks
- (Taken from my trello)
## Immediate dev tasks
- [ ] SimpleServiceLayer GetDataService<T> method should use a pattern to lookup the service for the data type
- [ ] Remove code smell of passing IServiceLayer where we only need a specific service
- [ ] Use Automapper Projections rather than Map in DAL to Domain mapping (lists only)

- [ ] Ease of use/design
- [ ] Are pages as created sensible?
- [ ] Attributes on ViewModels and EditModels - what can they do?
- [ ] Migrate to ASP.NET 5

## Medium term dev tasks
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Consider potential aggregates at repository level
- [ ] Implement error handling across the board
- [ ] Investigate JSON use
- [ ] Investigate and understand jQuery use
- [ ] Investigate AJAX
- [ ] Angular 2 framework
- [ ] Create a .NET Core version
- [ ] Model changes to allow stock tracking
    - knowing what I have in stock currently, not just what plants I have ever had
- [ ] OData services vs WCF vs WebAPI vs basic service layer. Odata is queryable
    - This is where the value of JSON comes in, as resources are returned as a JSON objects from the service. Will then need to convert back to data objects.
